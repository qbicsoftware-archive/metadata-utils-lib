Metadata Utils, version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT - A Java library to collect the metadata from an OpenBIS instance

## Author
Created by Jennifer BÃ¶dker (jennifer.boedker@student.uni-tuebingen.de).

## Description

This library generates an output containing the metadata for a given QBiC-Project-Code. 
In order to illustrate the QBiC data structure properly the library `data-model-lib` is included.

**What are OpenBIS-Properties?** OpenBis provides the possibility to store individual information. All these values are grouped by the term **Property**.
This should not be confused with a property `Q_PROPERTY` which is itself a QBiC-**Property**. Also, each **Property** could contain different information
depending on which type of sample it is used for.

## How to Install
`git clone https://github.com/qbicsoftware/metadata-utils-lib`    
`mvn clean install`    
to create a jar with dependencies included:    
`mvn clean package`

## Development

Following steps have to be performed to retrieve the meta data:

1. **Fetch the Project**: For a given OpenBIS project code the respective project is retrieved (if it exists).

2. **Fetch the Experiment and Corresponding Samples**: From this project the associated `Q_SAMPLE_PREPARATION` experiment with all its samples is fetched. 
                                                       
3. **Parse Experiment Factors**: If the experiment has `Q_PROPERTIES` (encoded as *XML*) the have to be parsed and assigned to the respective 
                                    samples of the experiment.
 
4. **Get Sample Meta Data**: For each sample of the experiment (they are of type `Q_TEST_SAMPLE`) retrieve information about the 
                              `Q_EXTERNALDB_ID`, `Q_SAMPLE_TYPE`, `Q_SECONDARY_NAME`, `Q_RNA_INTEGRITY_NUMBER` and the `Q_PROPERTIES` 
                              (also *XML* encoded, thus need to be parsed).

5. **Get Meta Data of Child-Samples**: Furthermore, the child of a sample is a sample of type `Q_NGS_SINGLE_SAMPLE_RUN` (for NGS projects) which contains the respective files.
                                        The filenames of the runs are retrieved by the property `Q_SECONDARY_NAME` (note that this property is 
                                        different to the `Q_SECONDARY_NAME` of samples of type `Q_TEST_SAMPLES`). A `Q_TEST_SAMPLE` can have multiple files!

6. **Get Meta Data of Parent-Samples**: The parent of a `Q_TEST_SAMPLES` is a `Q_BIOLOGICAL_SAMPLE` which holds the information about `Q_PRIMARY_TISSUE`.
                                         The parent of a `Q_BIOLOGICAL_SAMPLE` is a `Q_BIOLOGICAL_ENTITY` which holds the information about the `Q_NCBI_ORGANISM`.
                                         Both return an ID that needs to be mapped to a meaningful name: 
                                         This has to be done with the retrieved organism and the tissue to retrieve the label of the `VocabularyTerm`.
                                         
7. **Grouping**: Grouping should show which samples stem from the same organism. Thus, to retrieve this information for each sample (Q_TEST_SAMPLE) the entities have to
                 be retrieved and samples with the same entity are grouped together.
                 
                 
### Use Case

**Use Case Name**: Preparation Sample Metadata Retrieving

**Subject Area**: Data Analysis

**Business Event**: Request of Metadata 

**Actors**: Project Manager

**Use Case Overview**: User specifies an OpenBis project and gets a list of all available metadata per preparation sample.

**Preconditions**: Valid OpenBis project is available

**Termination Outcome**: 
1. All metadata gets returned
2. Some fields are marked with NA 
3. Some Metadata categories have the same name with different tags at the end of the name 

**Condition Affecting Termination Outcome**: 
1. All metadata is annotated
2. Missing metadata information
3. Some Metadata categories (factors or properties) occur multiply (on e.g different sample levels)

**Use Case Description**:
Following steps have to be performed to retrieve the meta data:

1. **Actor enters Project Code**: The system searches the corresponding project in the DB (OpenBIS).

2. **Fetch the Experiment and Corresponding Samples**: The system fetches the associated `Q_SAMPLE_PREPARATION` experiment with all samples. 

3. **Get Experiment Factors**: The system retrieves experiment factors.
                                                       
4. **Get Sample Meta Data and Factors**: For each sample of the experiment retrieve the properties and the factors.

5. **Filter Properties**: 
Filter the returned properties for:
- Preparation Sample QBiC Code
- Secondary Name
- Lab ID
- Sample Type (Analyte)
- Source
- Source Name(s)
- Source Lab ID(s)
- Extract Code(s)
- Extract Name(s)
- Extract Lab ID(s)
- Conditions
- Filenames
- Gender/Sex (e.g. male / female)
- Tissue (e.g. blood / liver / tumor)
- Entity QBiC Code (Grouping)
- RIN 

**Use Case Associations**: Extraction Sample Metadata Retrieving

**Traceability to**: (list of other related documents)

**Input Summary**: QBiC project barcode

**Output Summary**: All metadata (defined in the use case description) associated with the preparation samples of the given project

**Usability Index**: A number based on how this use case ranked in terms of satisfaction, importance, and frequency. (?)

**Use Case Notes**: Factors are encoded in XML, 
                    some sample properties need to be mapped to e.g. an organism (instead of an ID),
                    some projects have the same factors encoded on the experiment and on the sample level,
                    multiple samples can have the same factors
